                                I've had a long-standing interest in information technology. When I first received a computer as a youngster, I enjoyed playing computer games. Even back then, I aspired to be a programmer so that I could contribute to the development of video games. I was fascinated by how someone who could only write keywords could make the masterpieces that inspired me a lot. As I grew older, without a doubt, I made my decision to get into a prestigious university and become an IT specialist.

                <p class="main">This website was mainly made for our "Principles of information system" project, for us(<strong>"CREW 404"</strong>) in order to learn how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work. In our website, we are going to share you about our <a href="#hourofcode">hour of code</a> project and also <a href="#aboutus">about us</a> in this website! By the way, on the top left you can see our logo, maybe you know from which game it is? Yes! Our logo was inspired from <strong>Portal</strong> and <strong>Portal 2</strong> game, which is developed by <strong>"Valve"</strong>! But why did we associate our logo with "Portal"? The game "Portal" was an inspiring game for us, we all played that game when we were youngsters, and that is why we had an idea to replace our 0 from "404" to a portal itself! The game "Portal" was a logic game, where it required a lot of brainstorming and high IQ. Developing a website from scratch is also kind of a logic, and that is why we decided to have an easter egg from our favorite game. If you want to extra information about designers experience:</p>
