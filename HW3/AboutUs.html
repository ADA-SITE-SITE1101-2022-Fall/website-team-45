                Hello, my name is <strong>Naik Pashayev</strong> and I am a <i>Computer Science</i> student. I am 18 years
                old, I was born in <strong>Russia, Moscow</strong>. I began my school life in 2010, in <strong>Baku Middle School 284</strong>
                and studied there until grade 4. Then I went to <strong>ABC (Azerbaijan British College)</strong> in grade 5 until grade 9. For my
                highschool, I studied in <strong>ADA School.</strong>Why did I choose <strong>ADA University?</strong> I
                wanted to stay in my homeland and I wanted to study in the best university of <strong>Baku!</strong>
                I chose <strong>computer science</strong> because I was interested in computers from my childhood.
            </p>
