                Hello, my name is <strong>Naik Pashayev</strong> and I am a <i>Computer Science</i> student. I am 18 years
                old, I was born in <strong>Russia, Moscow</strong>. I began my school life in 2010, in <strong>Baku Middle School 284</strong>
                and studied there until grade 4. Then I went to <strong>ABC (Azerbaijan British College)</strong> in grade 5 until grade 9. For my
                highschool, I studied in <strong>ADA School.</strong>Why did I choose <strong>ADA University?</strong> I
                wanted to stay in my homeland and I wanted to study in the best university of <strong>Baku!</strong>
                I chose <strong>computer science</strong> because I was interested in computers from my childhood.
            </p>

               I've had a long-standing interest in information technology.
               When I first received a computer as a youngster, I enjoyed playing computer games. 
               Even back then,I aspired to be a programmer so that I could contribute to the development of video games.
               I was fascinated by how someone who could only write nonsensical English words could make the masterpieces
               that made me so happy at the time. As I grew older, another issue arose: how can I support myself?
               I was also drawn to the fact that members in this field must constantly understand new technology,
               expertise, and advancement. Then, without a doubt, I made my decision
               to get into a prestigious university and become a programmer.
